# FAQ
 + ## How do I run this?
    I made this on the Netebans IDE. 
    
    All the required JAR files are already in the resources folder.
    
    Just import this into any Java development IDE and execute the main class from there.
    :)
    
    EDIT : There was no main class created. You can test it out by running the Battle.java file.
    
# NOTICE
  Discontinued project due to lack of time and interest.
  
  Might restart later.
  
  Feel free to take it up :)
