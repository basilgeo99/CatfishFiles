Another hero bites the dust.
1
The hero falls. The world grows heavier and so do his eyes.
2
The young kindled spirit fades into obscurity.
3
The young flame slowly dies out.
4
The brave drops to his knees, head on his chest and sleeps.....for eternity.
5
Alas! He was too young.
6
Death befalls the hero.
